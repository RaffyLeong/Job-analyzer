🧠 Why I Built This
As a career-changer learning frontend development, I noticed that many developers and job seekers spend excessive time analyzing job descriptions manually. This tool was built to:
- **Save time** by automating the analysis process
- **Increase confidence** by showing exact skill matches
- **Provide direction** with personalized learning suggestions
- **Simplify job hunting** with a clean, focused interface

⚙️ How It Works
1. **Copy** a job description from LinkedIn, Indeed, or any job board
2. **Paste** it into the application
3. **Click Analyze** to see instant results
4. **Review** your match score, required skills, and personalized suggestions

🛠️ Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Vite (or Create React App)
- Tailwind CSS

- Deployment: Netlify


🚧 Challenges & Learnings
1. **Skill Detection Accuracy**: Ensuring the app correctly identifies technical skills from varied job description formats
2. **State Management**: Handling multiple states for analysis results and UI updates
3. **Edge Cases**: Dealing with job descriptions that don't mention specific technical skills
